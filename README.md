4. `package.json`: Lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
5. `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.


Chapter 8: Modifying the Chatbot Responses
You can modify how the chatbot responds by editing the `main.js` file. For example, you can change
the model being used or adjust the prompt templates.

Chapter 9:

Deploying to Vercel
Vercel is a popular platform for deploying web applications. To deploy your Gemini Chatbot to Vercel, follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
If you haven't already, install the Vercel CLI globally on your machine:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g vercel

Step 2:
Login to Vercel
Login to your Vercel account by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
vercel login
Follow the prompts to log in to your Vercel account.



Step 3: Deploy the Application
Navigate to your project directory and run:

bash
Copy code
vercel
The CLI will ask you a few questions:

For the first deployment, Vercel will ask if you want to link this directory to an existing project or create a new one. Choose "Create a new project".
Vercel will detect your framework and automatically configure the deployment settings.


Step 4:

Set Up Environment Variables
Vercel requires you to set environment variables for production. You can set the VITE_API_KEY environment variable directly in Vercel:

In your Vercel dashboard, navigate to the project settings.
Under the Environment Variables section, add a new variable:
Key: VITE_API_KEY
Value: Your Google API key
Save the changes.

Step 5:

Finalize the Deployment
After setting the environment variables, your deployment should proceed automatically. Vercel will provide you with a live URL where your Gemini Chatbot application is deployed.

Step 6: 

Accessing Your Deployed Application
Once the deployment is complete, you can access your chatbot application via the URL provided by Vercel.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run the Gemini Chatbot application. Feel
free to explore the code and customize the chatbot to suit your needs. Happy coding!
